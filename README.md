# Airline Route Simulation System

This project is a **C program** that simulates airline route management for South Indian Airlines. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest route between two airports based on travel costs. The program is designed to provide a user-friendly experience with an intuitive terminal-based interface.

## Features

### 1. **Airport Management**
- Supports the following airports:
  - Hyderabad
  - Bangalore
  - Chennai
  - Kochi
  - Goa
  - Andaman
  - Lakshadweep

### 2. **Shortest Path Calculation**
- Uses **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest route between the source and destination airports.
- Displays:
  - The total travel cost.
  - The route taken.

### 3. **User-Friendly Output**
- Enhanced terminal output with **color-coded results** for better readability.
- Error handling for invalid airport entries.
